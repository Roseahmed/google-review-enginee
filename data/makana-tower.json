      "text": "There's a whole bucket of water dripping from the closed windows every single time it rains. This is still the situation after the owner \"repaired\" the windows a couple of times.\nIt's been 3 months since I've been staying here and this problem has persisted from the very first week. Dampness in the walls makes the paint peel off and fall on the beds, making it impossible to live without paint chunks constantly falling on your face.\nOwner asked us to shift to a 1bhk when we pay rent for a 2bhk to fix the issue or shift to another building by ourselves. Not an issue we could have figured out before shifting, if we knew we would have never shifted here.\n\nBesides all these issues, there is very erratic water supply with no water for majority of the day. We've been given excuses of a tenant from the bottom floor \"forgetting\" to close the tap hence water runs out. There's been lack of a basic necessity such as water for a whole month now. Truly unlivable conditions.",
